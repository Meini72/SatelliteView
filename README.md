# Satellite VR Demo
This is a practice to show satellite VR view. It is also an interactive application, in which the player can manipulate (drag, rotate, zoom) the "spacecraft" to change the view they would like to watch.<br><br>
Please run the file index.html in nodejs environment. The project can be easily deployed on https://c9.io/.<br><br>
A snapshot of the application is shown below.<br><br>
